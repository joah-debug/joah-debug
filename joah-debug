# 📝 About
🔐 Aspiring Cybersecurity professional | Ethical Hacking Enthusiast | Hands-On Learner

I’m a motivated learner exploring the world of cybersecurity. I enjoy learning how to protect digital systems, find vulnerabilities ethically, and understand how attackers think so I can prevent real-world threats.

Currently, I’m building practical skills through hands-on labs and projects, including network scanning with Nmap, traffic analysis with Wireshark, and creating small tools in Python. I’m also learning Linux system hardening, basic penetration testing, and vulnerability management.

💻 **Skills & Tools I’m Learning**
- Nmap, Wireshark, Nessus (Essentials)
- Python & Bash scripting
- Linux & Windows systems
- Basic concepts in ethical hacking, network security, and risk management

🎯 **Career Goal**
To start my cybersecurity career, gain hands-on experience, and grow into roles like SOC Analyst, Security Engineer, or Penetration Tester.

🌐 **Let’s Connect**
Open to connecting with fellow learners, mentors, and cybersecurity professionals for guidance and collaboration.
